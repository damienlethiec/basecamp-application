  title: Because I learn fast...
  highlighted_text: ...and help others learn.
  last_part_text: 6 months ago, I had no idea how to write a single line of code. I now work as a freelance web developer and as a bootcamp teacher. I still know nothing but I can see how fast I learn. And by teaching at Le Wagon, I help others learn too. And I think I help them well!

product_oriented:
  title: Because I understand business and product...
  highlighted_text: ...not just code.
  last_part_text: Before finding my passion for web development, I was an entrepreneurship student at EMLYON, one of the top business schools in Europe. I had the opportunity to work in lead generation (for a YC company), as a growth hacker, as a startup advisor and to lead an association supporting social entrepreneurship. I know what business means and I am totally product oriented.

  highlighted_text: ...and I love it!
  last_part_text: I have always loved to travel. I lived 6 months in Tanzania, volunteered in Nicaragua and hitchhiked all over France. This past November, I decided to become a digital nomad. I went to Tha√Øland for 2 months, working for a client in France. I loved it. Since then, I only take remote missions and know how to make it work!

transparent:
  title: Because I value transparency a lot...
  highlighted_text: ...and I love to share.
  last_part_text: I have always had strong opinions. I love to have long talks with my friends about the meaning of life. This year, I decided I would share my thoughts to a broader audience and began a blog called "dlet.me". I plan to write an article every 2 weeks. I love to share and feel really comfortable in a transparent environment.

  highlighted_text: ...and this website is the first proof.
  last_part_text: I love Basecamp! I read a lot about your company, your culture, and your people and I am a big fan. I know I will grow as a developer and as a person if I join you and I am sure I can bring a lot to the company. I built this website during my evenings and weekends to convince you that I will do what it takes.
