Hey, Iâ€™m Damien Le Thiec, your summer internship applicant.

I love building projects! As long as I remember, I have always been this crazy guy with lots of ideas who finally manages to make some of them work with hard work and dedication. My projects are my babies and I love seing them grow. I guess I should become a father someday...

In the last years, I started to become frustrated... I had a lot of digital projects in my head but no way to test them easily. I had to learn one skill: coding.

Last summer, I joined [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/) to solve this problem. It was the best choice of my life! I literally felt in love with code. So much intellectual challenge, so much to learn, but also so much potential!

In the last 6 months, my life totally changed. I was a business school student, I am now a freelance Ruby on Rails developer and a code teacher at Le Wagon. I travel a lot too and work remotely with my clients. I am growing so much, professionally and as a person, that I would not change this life for anything in the world.

And this is my main goal now. I want to grow! More importantly, I want to grow consistently!

One month ago, I took the time to really think about what I wanted to achieve in 2017, about what would help me grow. I decided that becoming a better Ruby on Rails developer would be one of my goals this year. This is why I want to join you at Basecamp for a summer internship. Feel free to read all my goals for the year [in this article.](https://dlet.me/fuck-new-year-resolutions-long-live-concrete-goals-b9124cf2c9f7)

But why Basecamp? Because you are the best (at least for me)! Your CTO changed my life by building my favorite framework, you drive the change to remote work and you develop an amazing product. I totally see how I could fit in your company culture and I am really excited just thinking about it!

Of course, I am still relatively new to code... but i'm a fast learner! And I am the most motivated guy you will find! I will do everything it takes to make this internship work and to bring a really special spirit to your company.

You can learn more about why I think we should work together in [the "How I work" page.](http://summer-at-basecamp.dlet.me/pages/how_I_work)

I am looking forward to talking to you!

Damien Le Thiec, your (hopefully) future intern at Basecamp
